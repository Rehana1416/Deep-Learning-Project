Title: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using Transformer-Based Attention Models

1. Introduction
Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in engineering and data-driven applications such as signal processing, energy demand prediction, financial analysis, and system monitoring. Traditional statistical models such as ARIMA have been widely used for forecasting tasks; however, they are limited in their ability to model nonlinear and multivariate temporal dependencies.

Recent advances in deep learning have introduced Transformer architectures, which utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range temporal relationships without relying on recurrent structures. This project explores the application of a Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting and compares its performance with a classical ARIMA baseline.

2. Dataset Description
A synthetic multivariate time series dataset was generated consisting of three correlated variables:
    Variable 1: Noisy sine wave
    Variable 2: Noisy cosine wave
    Variable 3: Combined nonlinear sine-cosine interaction

The dataset contains 3000 time steps. All variables were standardized using zero-mean and unit-variance normalization to ensure stable training and prevent scale dominance across features.

3. Preprocessing and Sequence Construction
The continuous time series was converted into supervised learning samples using a sliding window approach. Each input sequence consists of 30 consecutive timesteps, and the target corresponds to the next timestep prediction for all three variables.

Standardization was performed prior to sequence generation to improve optimization stability and accelerate convergence.

4. Model Architecture
The forecasting model is based on a Transformer Encoder architecture. The model consists of:
    A linear embedding layer projecting the input features into a higher-dimensional latent space
    Sinusoidal positional encoding to preserve temporal ordering
    A stack of Transformer Encoder layers with multi-head self-attention
    A fully connected output layer predicting the next timestep values

Key architectural parameters include:
    Embedding dimension (d_model): 64
    Number of attention heads: 4
    Number of encoder layers: 2
    Sequence length: 30

This architecture enables the model to learn both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies across multiple variables.

5. Positional Encoding Justification
Transformers lack an inherent notion of temporal order. To address this, sinusoidal positional encoding was incorporated into the input embeddings. This encoding allows the model to distinguish between different temporal positions using deterministic sine and cosine functions.

The use of sinusoidal encoding avoids additional trainable parameters and supports generalization to sequences of varying lengths. Positional encoding is essential for time series data, as temporal ordering directly influences predictive relevance.

6. Hyperparameter Selection and Training Strategy
Hyperparameters were selected empirically based on training stability and convergence behavior. The embedding dimension was chosen to balance representational capacity and computational efficiency. Increasing the dimension beyond 64 resulted in marginal improvements with significantly higher computational cost.

The model was trained for 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used as the loss function. A batch size of 32 was selected to ensure stable gradient updates while maintaining efficient training.

7. Baseline Model: ARIMA
To provide a traditional statistical benchmark, an ARIMA(5,1,0) model was implemented. Due to its inherent univariate nature, ARIMA was applied only to the first variable of the dataset.

Although ARIMA cannot model multivariate or nonlinear dependencies, it serves as a reference point for comparing classical forecasting approaches against modern deep learning techniques.

8. Evaluation Methodology
Model performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics:
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

The Transformer model predictions were evaluated on batch-level samples drawn from the dataset, while ARIMA performance was evaluated on a hold-out segment of the univariate time series.

9. Results
The Transformer model achieved the following performance:
    RMSE: 0.1060
    MAE: 0.0868
    MAPE: 30.78%

The ARIMA model produced significantly higher errors:
    RMSE: 0.7805
    MAE: 0.5739
    MAPE: 627.18%

10. Discussion
The results demonstrate that the Transformer model significantly outperforms the ARIMA baseline across all evaluation metrics. The performance gain is attributed to the Transformer’s ability to capture multivariate and nonlinear temporal dependencies through self-attention.

The comparatively poor performance of ARIMA highlights its limitations when applied to noisy, nonlinear, and multivariate time series data.

11. Limitations and Future Work
The current study is limited by batch-level evaluation and the use of a single traditional baseline. Future work will include:
    Full train-validation-test split evaluation
    Additional benchmarks such as LSTM and GRU models
    Evaluation on real-world datasets
    Multivariate statistical baselines where applicable

12. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Transformer-based architectures for multivariate time series forecasting. The integration of positional encoding and self-attention enables superior modeling of temporal dependencies compared to traditional statistical methods. The results validate the Transformer as a powerful and interpretable forecasting framework for complex time series data.
